### ABOUT US ü•≥ üöÄ

**Lead Dev **
** Backend **
** Frontend - structure **
Final project for Le Wagon's web development bootcamp in Montreal - batch #640. <p>  A MVP version was presented on November 6, 2021. You can view our demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDrsmeKQaPY&t=852s" target="_blank"> here </a> </p>
<p>
  Many people have all sorts of food allergies or dietary restrictions.
  Diet profiles such as vegan, paleo, keto, etc are not always known by everyone
  This is a web-app to simplify the process of finding a restaurant that fits your needs along with those of your group
</p>

  DIET PROFILES: They can select from a range of popular categories, and further customize it (ex: paleo but allergic to raw garlic)
NETWORK: They can connect with their friends on the application, so profiles can be combined for searches
MENUS: A repository of restaurants' online menus is maintained, while encouraging restaurant owners/chefs to fill in the blanks (listing ingredients not mentioned in meal descriptions). Users are encouraged to report additional information like an unlisted allergen in a dish they experienced
SEARCH: [...] with a percentage rating based on the number of available options in a menu. Can add sorting filters to take other factors into account such as distance, google reviews rating, price range etc..
